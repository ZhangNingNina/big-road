    The employment market is still highly competitive and the employment trend is constantly changing. Under the influence of the era of new media, the media industry seems to have begun to become a hot spot of employment. At the same time, China's "13th Five-Year Plan" has also proposed that the cultural industry should become a pillar industry of the national economy in 2020. So, what is the current job market? And as the graduates of the media, how can we choose our job in the future?
    </p>

    <h2>The Context of the Fresh Graduates’ Employment</h2>

    <h3>There are amounts of industries...</h3>

    <p> Like the Internet, Financial service, Media industry and so on. </p>

    <h3>But which one is most popular among those fresh graduates?</h3>

    <p>
     We can see that the IT/Internet industry ranks first in the industry's most concerned industry distribution rankings with a 43.3% share, and it has a big gap with the rest of the industry. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>So what about the cities that they want to work in? </h3>

                    var bHeight = iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight;  
                    var dHeight = iframe.contentWindow.document.documentElement.scrollHeight;  
                    var height = Math.max(bHeight, dHeight);  
                    iframe.height =  height;  
                    console.log(height);

            window.setInterval("reinitIframe()", 200);

    </responsive-block>
    <p>We found that these graduates are more eager to work in some first-tier cities, such as Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hangzhou.</p>
    <p>From what have mentioned above, it seems that most of people who want to enter the IT industry always take salary into their first consideration, but for those people willing to get into the media industry, they might think that it is not so important.
    </p>
    <p>But let’s look at the average wages disparity in different industries</p>

                    var dHeight = iframe.contentWindow.document.documentElement.scrollHeight;

                    iframe.height =  height;  
                    console.log(height);
                }catch (ex){}  
            }  

            window.setInterval("reinitIframe()", 200);  
        </script>

       But actually, the rate of salary can be influenced by our educational background.

    <p>After understanding the background of so many different industries and companies, we can actually find that the Internet has indeed become a hot trend in employment. However, it seems that we have not seen the shadow of the media industry in the various rankings above. So what is the situation in the media industry?</p>
    
    <h2>The situation of the fresh graduates’ employment in Media industry</h2>
    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>Going back to the popular companies mentioned above, although there are no media companies on the list, there may be people who want to know if Internet companies also need media talents. Is there a media department?</p>
    <p>However, we found that these Internet companies are basically recruiting technicians. Apart from the number of non-technical personnel recruited by “阿里”, the basics are not related to the media.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/zhiwei1.png" alt="">
        <img src="images/zhiwei2.png" alt="">
        <img src="images/zhiwei3.png" alt="">

    <p>Although the facts are a bit sad, let's go back to the media industry to conduct research.</p>
    <h3>Media industry and Types of Media Company</h3>

    <p>So firstly, let's look at the salary and geographical distribution.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/salary&grade_media.png" alt="">

    <p>All media companies have an average salary of 5413.7RMB, and the maximum is about 15840.</p>

    <h2>How is the Situation of Employment for Media students?</h2>
    <p>We all know that as a media industry, some essential qualities are the key to the company's selection. However, after scraping <a href="https://www.zhipin.com">boss直聘网</a> and there are 2059 results was given back, we get the job recruitment from the company in media, advertising, marketing, education, Internet Industry.</p>
    <p>We found that work experience is also a very important factor for the media industry.</p>
    <p>Let’s look at this graph here.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/output_7_0.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>The requirement of 3-5 years working experience takes up in a quite large part in every province, especially in the more developed province like Shanghai and Guangdong, while graduate students takes up a relatively small part.</p>
    <p>And work experience even determines our salary.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/haha.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>For graduate students likes us，in the first 3 years our salary won’t change that much, however in the 3-10 years the jobs offers 20-50k per month was growing.
    </p>
    
    <p>We want to share something for you.</p>
